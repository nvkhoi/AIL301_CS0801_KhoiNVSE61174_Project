# AIL301_CS0801_KhoiNVSE61174_Project
This repo contains source code and output for projects of subject AIL301 made by Nguyen Van Khoi of class CS0801.
Any idea is welcome. 

- Source code in R language for project 1 - clustering:

   + Using partial color histogram with 3 layers
   + Clustering by built-in kmeans
- The output of source code after learning 25 times

After many time trying:
- Running time (fastest to slowest): color averaging, color histogram
- Result: partial color histogram is the best (in my view), many similar images go into same group. It looks like more "reasonable" than the others.
